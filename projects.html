            <h2>MonopolAR</h2>
            <p>
                This was a group project that I worked with during my first year
                in GIMM, and was the second project that I used Augmented Reality 
                tools for. The point should be obvious: it is a version of Monopoly 
                that runs on your phone using augmented reality. My team had 4 
                members including myself, and we used the Unity Engine to build 
                the app.
                <br><br>
                My main task on this project was the augmented reality functions,
                although I did help with some of the other systems to get the app 
                working. There were a few technical issues in the project, mainly
                our devices we used for testing were consistently failing to run 
                augmented reality properly, along with a short 4-5 week deadline.
                Despite that, the app has all the major functions of monopoly.
                <br><br>
                This project happened a few months ago, so now the previously
                mentioned technical issues are not a problem. Here's some pictures
                of the app both in Unity and the actual app.

            <h2>individual game, not sure what the name is</h2>
            <p>
                This project was another project I did in my first year in GIMM,
                although this one was made as an individual project, once again
                in Unity. I created all the assets and code for this game on my
                own.
                <br><br>
                Since I already had prior Unity experience going into this project,
                I chose to take the time to learn about Augmented Reality and 
                implemented it into this project. Specifically, I used an Ultraleap
                tracking camera for the project, which was implemented into the 
                gameplay via using various hand movements.
                <br><br>
                This game has simple gameplay, mainly being a two-dimensional side
                scrolling platformer, with the added benefit of the player having 
                a fireball attack. As the player plays, they can finnd other items
                that improve or add new skills the player can use. Despite being a 
                concept, I developed the game with some thinking for how future 
                levels could be made to expand upon the game.
                <br><br>
                It is worth noting that I have continued working on this project
                since the original project I submitted for the GIMM class. That
                being said, I also made a video detailing some of the development
                process, and most of said video is still relevant to my project in 
                its current state. Here's that video for reference.

            <h2>GIMM Smart Chair</h2>
            <p>
                This project was one I did during my internship on the GIMM Works
                development team, where me and another intern got to develop a smart 
                chair as an Internet of Things prototype. This project involved 
                learning a few new skills, including using Arduino and it introduced
                me to web hosting services. We also made a simple web app interface 
                for the smart chair using basic HTML/CSS and PHP.
                <br><br>
                I learned most of what I learned about Arduino during this process,
                and along with that I learned plenty about sending HTTP requests,
                considering that was how we decided upon sending data to our web 
                server. I also got to use a more professional development cycle for
                the first time, given we had to create a general design for the chair,
                before creating our prototype of the chair we ended up with. It is 
                my understanding that this prototype was adapted to help form the 
                GIMM 340 class.
                <br><br>
                This project also inevitably had a video created documenting our 
                development of the smart chair. Here's said video:

            <h2>Java Tower Defense</h2>
            <p>
                This is an oler project I made when I was first learning to use 
                Java, as the name implies. I did this project on my own during 
                my junior year in high school, so most of the project was me 
                practicing how to program in Java.
                <br><br>
                This game had a lot of basic functions working too, you could 
                place towers to defend against waves of enemies, who would follow
                the brown path on the screen. These towers would attack the enemies
                and gain money you could use to create more towers. Beyond that,
                I didn't implement too many other features, and I stopped working
                on this project during my senior year of high school.
                <br><br>
                I somehow still have the code for this project sitting around,
                but for now I will show off some pictures I took of the project:

            <h2>Other Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I worked on a few other projects in the past few years that I think
                are worth mentioning here. Some of my involvement in these projects 
                was limited, or I was only working on the project for a short time,
                but I believe they are still worth mentioning here.

                    I worked on a couple projects for my school during 12th grade which
                    were started a few years prior by other students, the main one being
                    a game called Star Saber. It is a game similar to Galaga, where you
                    fly a spaceship through a lot of enemy spaceships and try to survive
                    as long as possible.
                    <br><br>
                    I supposedly had an artist who was willing to help create new assets
                    for the game, but they rarely worked on the project for most of that 
                    time. I spent most of my time on the project fixing bugs and polishing
                    as much as possible.
                    <br><br>
                    Surprisingly, I still have a build of this project available, so I took
                    a video of some gameplay for this site.

                    Another project I helped with for my high school was another game
                    called Dragon Champs, which more or less is a fighting game involving
                    the teachers at our high school. I spent much less time on this project,
                    at most about 3 weeks at the end of the year, and most of that time 
                    was spent with me trying to learn how most of the systems in the 
                    project worked.
                    <br><br>
                    I have less to say about this project and unfortunately I do not have
                    a build of this one either, so this is as much as I can say.

                    While I spent most of my internship with GIMM Works developing the 
                    smart chair prototype, I did have a couple tasks I worked on for the 
                    Beam Tours app. At the time, the project was called Bronco Beam, 
                    and most of my work was helping update some designs or fix some small 
                    bugs that others were encountering on the project.
                    <br><br>
                    I also do not have any builds of the version of this project that I 
                    worked on.
