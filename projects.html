            <h2>MonopolAR</h2>
            <p>
                This was a group project that I worked with during my first year
                in GIMM, and was the second project that I used Augmented Reality 
                tools for. The point should be obvious: it is a version of Monopoly 
                that runs on your phone using augmented reality. My team had 4 
                members including myself, and we used the Unity Engine to build 
                the app.
                <br><br>
                My main task on this project was the augmented reality functions,
                although I did help with some of the other systems to get the app 
                working. There were a few technical issues in the project, mainly
                our devices we used for testing were consistently failing to run 
                augmented reality properly, along with a short 4-5 week deadline.
                Despite that, the app has all the major functions of monopoly.
                <br><br>
                This project happened a few months ago, so now the previously
                mentioned technical issues are not a problem. Here's some pictures
                of the app both in Unity and the actual app.

            <h2>individual game, not sure what the name is</h2>
            <p>
                This project was another project I did in my first year in GIMM,
                although this one was made as an individual project, once again
                in Unity. I created all the assets and code for this game on my
                own.
                <br><br>
                Since I already had prior Unity experience going into this project,
                I chose to take the time to learn about Augmented Reality and 
                implemented it into this project. Specifically, I used an Ultraleap
                tracking camera for the project, which was implemented into the 
                gameplay via using various hand movements.
                <br><br>
                This game has simple gameplay, mainly being a two-dimensional side
                scrolling platformer, with the added benefit of the player having 
                a fireball attack. As the player plays, they can finnd other items
                that improve or add new skills the player can use. Despite being a 
                concept, I developed the game with some thinking for how future 
                levels could be made to expand upon the game.
                <br><br>
                It is worth noting that I have continued working on this project
                since the original project I submitted for the GIMM class. That
                being said, I also made a video detailing some of the development
                process, and most of said video is still relevant to my project in 
                its current state. Here's that video for reference.

            <h2>GIMM Smart Chair</h2>
            <p>
                This project was one I did during my internship on the GIMM Works
                development team, where me and another intern got to develop a smart 
                chair as an Internet of Things prototype. This project involved 
                learning a few new skills, including using Arduino and it introduced
                me to web hosting services. We also made a simple web app interface 
                for the smart chair using basic HTML/CSS and PHP.
                <br><br>
                I learned most of what I learned about Arduino during this process,
                and along with that I learned plenty about sending HTTP requests,
                considering that was how we decided upon sending data to our web 
                server. I also got to use a more professional development cycle for
                the first time, given we had to create a general design for the chair,
                before creating our prototype of the chair we ended up with. It is 
                my understanding that this prototype was adapted to help form the 
                GIMM 340 class.
                <br><br>
                This project also inevitably had a video created documenting our 
                development of the smart chair. Here's said video:
