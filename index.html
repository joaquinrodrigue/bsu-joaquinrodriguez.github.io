            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Joaquin Rodriguez, a student at Boise State University in    
                both 'Games, Interactive Media and Mobile', and Computer Science.
                <br><br>
                I have been programming since my freshman year of high school, and
                have since learned Java, JavaScript, C#, PHP, SQL, HTML and CSS,
                and I have some experience with Python and React.js.

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>
                I have been learning to use the Unity Game Engine for almost as 
                long as I have been programming. I got a certification as a Unity
                Engine Certified Programmer during my first year using Unity. 
                Since then, I've been working on various games from projects for 
                school to just learning new things about the engine.
                <br><br>
                I also participated in SkillsUSA, an organization that helps build
                leadership and technical skills, ever since my sophomore year of
                high school. I have competed in a Web Design state competition 
                where my team got second place, and two computer programming state 
                competitions, where I managed to get second place as well.
                <br><br>
                Since then, I have entered the Honors College at Boise State 
                University where this is my first year, and I continued going to
                the Boise State chapter of SkillsUSA. I also joined the Boise 
                State game dev club recently, where I am focusing on improving my
                skills with Unity.
